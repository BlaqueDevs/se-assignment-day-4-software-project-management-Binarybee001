# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Through timely delivery, it ensures that we as the software project management don't keep the client waiting for the end product for a long period of time. Moreover, it instills more confidence on the client that the management is more reliable and can be trusted. Project managers should ensure that the deadlines are met through enough tool equipment for the project, allocating enough financial resources needed for the project completion and task allocation on the rest of the developers to ensure that there is no confusion while working on the project.  
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures that a project comes out as a success since by allocating enough funds towards a project, it will reduce the level of delays like lacking enough tools to complete a project. Some of the startegies that may reduce budget overruns are such as proper planning before starting the actual project. Proper preparation before embarking on a project to ensure that the tools to be acquired are of the estimated budget.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology uses iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development while on emphasizing flexibility while waterfall methodology uses linear and sequential approach and each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Advantage of Agile methodology
-Flexible since it allows for continuous change and adapts to the required environmnet.
-The project is broken to smaller deliverables hence there is regular customer feedback.
-There is regular testing of the project hence the final product is of high quality.
Disadvantage of Agile methodology
-It requires a very high skilled team in order to use such a methodology.
-Since it has a flexible scope and frequent changes it is difficult to estimate the time and cost to be used in the project.
-It requires a regular customer involvement.
Advantages of Waterfall methodology
-The structure is clear and documented.
-It is easy to manage since it is clearly divided into stages.
-The plan is defined upront hence the costs are predictable.
Disadvantages of Waterfall methodology
- It is inflexible in that once a phase is completed going back to it for changes is often difficult.
- The testing of the final product often occurs later in the process.
-  The project may fail to meet the clients expectation If there is needs communicaton.  
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile type of methodology is more beneficial to projects that require flexibility, frequent client feedback and iterative development.
Good examples of such projects are such as:
-Projects that are evolving and allow for adaptation to take place through iterative cycles eg. software development.
-Projects that are majorly influenced by client feedback  in which they must see progress regularly eg. Website redesign.
-Projects that are majorly experimental and can give room for flexibility and exploration such as Reseaerch and development.
Waterfall type of methodology requires projects that are clearly well defined and it is very unlikely to face any major changes.
Good examples are as follows:
-Projects that have a fixed types of requirements such as that of building and construction.
-Projects that require strict following of guidelines and regulatories such as that of the healthcare and medical systems.
-Projects which are very large and have a lot of complexities to be followed fro it to function like that of the government systems and defense systems.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
-Test Drvien Development in which developers write down a test on the code before the begin writing down the actual program, this ensures that they catch bugs in advance.
-Performance testing in which developers conduct a vigorous test on the software as they code to ensure that the program performs in the correct manner.
-Pair programming that is two software developers work together on a project, while one writes the piece of code the other one proofs read to ensure that the written code is correct and no bugs can be identified.
The importance of maintaining high standards are as follows:
-It ensures that the project being worked on will of a very high quality.
-It improves the User Experience the project is deployed to the public for use.
-It ensures that the project is cost effective due to a proper planning.
-It ensures that the company that is working on the project gains a high level of reputation hence can gain future clients.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
By being able to define a project scope, it ensures that the project comes out as a success in the following ways:
-It ensures that the projects objectives are clearly stated and that there is a mutual understanding between the developers on what to achieve by the end of the project.
-It gives an outline on how the project or program should function by the time the end product is released.
-Through a project scope, it will ensure that is cost effective in that the budget will not be less nor more than required.
-The final project will be of a very high quality due to the objectives being attained.
A Work Breakdown Structure is a project management tool that is solely responsible of breaking down a project into small,simpler and manageable sizes for easy control and assigning among developers.
It is useful in the sense that:
-Small tasks can be easily handed over to various developers to easen the burden and increase efficiency while working on a project.
-Through it, it saves on time while working on a project since each person is assigned a specific task to work on it.
-Control and management over the project is easy for the project manager since he/she is able to identify and supervise on each task with ease.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Project schedules are of much benefit before embarking on project and they are as follows:
-Saves on time since from the schedule the team working on a project are able to know the start and completion date of a project.
-In a project schedule, a task list is also created hence giving the team an idea in what they are supposed to be doing while working on the project.
-It also cost effective since the team is able to know the number of resources they require during the time of the project therefore no money will be under or overspent.
-It enhances team work among the members since the tasks will be allocated to everyone of them in which it will require their collaboration in order to complete a certain project.
In this case Gantt charts are useful in the sense that:
-They are able to breakdown tasks to be conducted during the project making it easy for the manager to supervise.
-Gantt charts contain timelines in which a specific task should start and end hence reducing time wastage.
-Gantt also offer tracking of progress therefore the team is able to know whether they are doing better or worse and where to improve.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The core issue that my software aims to address is finding of vacant rental homes in which people can identify with ease with a touch of a button without them having to walk for long distances while looking for a suitable place.
This problem is significant in that many people waste a lot time that they would be using to do other important things other than finding a suitable place to live. Therefore through this software, they are able to look for the homes of their dreams and rental budget at the comfort of their homes, work or even school(for students). 
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clear identification and defining of the problem will enable me to come with a proper software solution in the following ways:
-Proper planning in that I will come up with a structure on how the software will be developed to combact the problem identified problem and how the society will be positively affected.
-Proper financing in that before developing the software I must ensure that the tools required for the job are identified and acquired to make completion of the project faster.
-Proper task management. Since the problem is identified and a solution also identified, the project needs to be broken down into smaller manageable tasks that can be done easily and produce a high quality and user friendly software.
-Time management in that since the problem and the solution is identified, I will be able to roughly estimate the time required to complete the project in order to avoid wastage of time.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Time-saving and efficiency. By using my software it enables one making home identification very easy in accordance to your budget at the comfort of your home, work or school. With that it is also very efficient irregardless of where you are in the country. 
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
It is a user friendly software that solves the problem of housing for majority of people in the counrty. It also acts as a platform where the landlords/ladies or even real estate firms are able to find market for there houses without using a lot of effort or even money in marketing there vacant houses.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
The real estate sector has shown a significant increase over the years growing from 6.7% in 2019 to 7.3% in 2023 in Kenya. With my software in place, the real estate needs a platform where they can market there products(houses) at a cheaper cost. Since the price of marketing is a bit expensive, I will leverage on it by placing a lower cost, and being able to connect the tenant to the landlord/lady or real estate firm by offering a suitable playing field. This will generate an exponential growth rate of my software.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
By understanding the market trends, I will be able to statistically identify the times when most Kenyans look for places to live, when they move and what rental price ranges do they most prefer. This will enable me and my team to update the software push a more personalized market to each and every user so that they can easily find a home to live in.
